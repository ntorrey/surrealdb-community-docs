# 1. Setup

## Setting up a users table

First, you need a place to store the usernames and passwords. It's best to setup a schemafull table for this with a unique field for the user's email. If you accidentally signup a second user with the same email, it will cause both email signups to fail. For now, only a schemafull table in SurrealDB allows a UNIQUE index field. (There is a proposal to allow for schemafull fields in a schemafull table which would be cool!)

The table could be something like this:

```sql
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL
	PERMISSIONS
		FOR select, update WHERE id = $auth.id,
		FOR create, delete NONE;
DEFINE FIELD username ON user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD password ON user TYPE string;
DEFINE INDEX idx_user ON user COLUMNS user UNIQUE;
```
