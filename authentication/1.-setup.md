# Authentication

## Setting up a users table

First, you need a place to store the usernames and passwords. It's best to setup a schemafull table for this with a unique field for the user's email. If you accidentally signup a second user with the same email, it will cause both email signups to fail. For now, only a schemafull table in SurrealDB allows a UNIQUE index field. (There is a proposal to allow for schemafull fields in a schemafull table which would be cool!)

The table could be something like this:

```sql
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL
	PERMISSIONS
		FOR select, update WHERE id = $auth.id,
		FOR create, delete NONE;
DEFINE FIELD username ON user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD password ON user TYPE string;
DEFINE INDEX idx_user ON user COLUMNS user UNIQUE;
```

## Scopes

Before signing up, we need to define a scope. A scope defines what permissions a user has. It also defines how long the jwt token is good for (Where it says 'SESSION'). When signing up, you specify the scope that the user is signing up for and it will run the corresponding SIGNUP method defined in the scope of that name.

<pre><code>DEFINE SCOPE allusers
<strong>    -- the JWT session will be valid for 14 days
</strong>    SESSION 14d

    -- The optional SIGNUP clause will be run when calling the signup method for this scope
    -- It is designed to create or add a new record to the database.
    -- If set, it needs to return a record or a record id
    -- Variables can be passed in to the signup method (In this example, the $tags variable.)

    SIGNUP ( CREATE user SET email = $email, password = crypto::argon2::generate($pass), tags = $tags )

    -- The optional SIGNIN clause will be run when calling the signin method for this scope
    -- It is designed to check if a record exists in the database.
    -- If set, it needs to return a record or a record id
    -- Variables can be passed in to the signin method

    SIGNIN ( SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = $email AND crypto::argon2::compare(password, $pass) )
    -- this clause IS NOT OPTIONAL!
```</code></pre>

## Signup/Signin

The javascript signup method takes the object that you pass it and runs it through the SIGNUP method that you defined in the corresponding SCOPE (previous step), which, in turn, will create a record in the table specified in the SIGNUP method. The signup method will return a JWT token (which contains encoded within it the properties of the object that you passed in). It will also immediately 'activate' those permissions on the db object (since you ran db.signup...).&#x20;

Scopes are defined on the database level, but the authentication parameters (available once a user is signed in to a scope), are made available everywhere. From Tobie: "The authentication process will always be linked with just one SurrealDB scope. But you can put whatever you want on the $auth or $token objects. The scope itself is just a way of defining the signup/signin logic, and/or the authentication tokens. It doesn’t prevent you from defining your own tag/category/scope logic on the jwt token, or the authenticated user record.

### Types of Signup/Signin methods

At the moment, only the RootAuth and ScopeAuth seem to work.

**RootAuth**

Gives you access to all the tables and database metadata. Does not return a token.

```js
{ user: string; pass: string; }
```

**NamespaceAuth**

```js
{ NS: string; user: string; pass: string; }
```

**DatabaseAuth**

```js
{ DB: string; NS: string; user: string; pass: string; }
```

**ScopeAuth**

Gives access to the scope. Both the signup/signin methods return a token.

```javascript
{ NS: string; DB: string; SC: string; [key: string]: unknown; }
```

For example:

```javascript
db.signup({
    NS: 'my_ns',
    DB: 'my_db',
    SC: 'allusers', // We want to signup to the 'allusers' scope defined above
    email: 'test@acme.com',
    password: 'some password',
});
-> This will return a token.
```

## Tokens

To define a token , we can run the following:

```
DEFINE TOKEN my_token ON SCOPE account TYPE HS512 VALUE "my_secret_encryption_key";
```

Then we can signup with the following object passed as a parameter which will also generate a token with the following info:

```javascript
{ 
  "iss": "Auth0", 
  "account": "account:ajd82kvn48vl2m3", 
  "exp": 1516239022, 
  "NS": "my_ns", 
  "DB": "my_dbja", 
  "SC": "account", 
  "TK": "my_token", 
  "ID": "user:10fnvk20r8vn20eiv" 
}
```

Then you can use the token or the auth variable in permissions clauses:

```sql
DEFINE FIELD account ON TABLE note
  PERMISSIONS
    FOR create, update, select, delete
    -- Where the account field of the JWT (which is a record id) matches the account field of the document
      WHERE account = $token.account 
      -- The account field of the logged-in user (taken from the ID field on the JWT) matches the account field of the document
      OR account = $auth.account 
```

The use of scopes is flexible. You could have a 'permissions' object on each user account which specifies what a user could do, and then you could check that on each of the permissions clauses, or you could segregate different user types (admins / users) into separate scopes.

## Auth Variables

In SurrealDB, there are built-in variables that can be used:

* `$auth` taken from the `ID` field in the JWT (is the record id of the logged in user). Therefore `$auth.name.first` would be the user's name.
* `$scope` is the name of the scope (account or contact or something)
* `$token` is the JWT claims (an object)

Then you can use the $token or the $auth variable in permissions clauses:

```sql
DEFINE FIELD account ON TABLE note
  PERMISSIONS
    FOR create, update, select, delete
    -- Where the account field of the JWT (which is a record id) matches the account field of the document
      WHERE account = $token.account 
      -- The account field of the logged-in user (taken from the ID field on the JWT) matches the account field of the document
      OR account = $auth.account 
```

The use of scopes is flexible. You could have a 'permissions' object on each user account which specifies what a user could do, and then you could check that on each of the permissions clauses, or you could segregate different user types (admins / users) into separate scopes.

## Table Permissions

You could set up a table's permissions like this:

<pre class="language-sql"><code class="lang-sql">DEFINE TABLE contact SCHEMAFULL 
<strong>	PERMISSIONS 
</strong>		FOR select 
			WHERE ($scope = "account" AND account = $account AND (SELECT * FROM $auth.access WHERE account = $account AND (admin = true OR permissions.crm ∋ "s") LIMIT 1)) 
			OR ($scope = "contact" AND id = $auth.id) 
			OR ($scope = "contact" AND distinct(applications.*.campaign.*.connections.*.contact) ∋ $auth.id) 
			OR ($scope = "contact" AND distinct(connections.*.campaign.*.connections.*.contact) ∋ $auth.id) 
		FOR create 
			WHERE ($scope = "account" AND account = $account AND (SELECT * FROM $auth.access WHERE account = $account AND (admin = true OR permissions.crm ∋ "c") LIMIT 1)) 
		FOR update 
			WHERE ($scope = "account" AND account = $account AND (SELECT * FROM $auth.access WHERE account = $account AND (admin = true OR permissions.crm ∋ "u") LIMIT 1)) 
			OR ($scope = "contact" AND id = $auth.id) 
			OR ($scope = "contact" AND distinct(applications.*.campaign.*.connections.*.contact) ∋ $auth.id) 
		FOR delete 
			WHERE ($scope = "account" AND account = $account AND (SELECT * FROM $auth.access WHERE account = $account AND (admin = true OR permissions.crm ∋ "d") LIMIT 1))</code></pre>

(∋ means "Contains". You can also write it as CONTAINS)
