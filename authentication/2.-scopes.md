# 2. Scopes

Before signing up, we need to define a scope. A scope defines what permissions a user has. It also defines how long the jwt token is good for (Where it says 'SESSION'). When signing up, you specify the scope that the user is signing up for and it will run the corresponding SIGNUP method defined in the scope of that name.

<pre><code>DEFINE SCOPE allusers
<strong>    -- the JWT session will be valid for 14 days
</strong>    SESSION 14d

    -- The optional SIGNUP clause will be run when calling the signup method for this scope
    -- It is designed to create or add a new record to the database.
    -- If set, it needs to return a record or a record id
    -- The variables can be passed in to the signin method (In this example, he uses $marketing and $tags variables.)

    SIGNUP ( CREATE user SET email = $email, password = crypto::argon2::generate($pass) )

    -- The optional SIGNIN clause will be run when calling the signin method for this scope
    -- It is designed to check if a record exists in the database.
    -- If set, it needs to return a record or a record id
    -- The variables can be passed in to the signin method

    SIGNIN ( SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = $email AND crypto::argon2::compare(password, $pass) )
    -- this optional clause will be run when calling the signup method for this scope
```</code></pre>
