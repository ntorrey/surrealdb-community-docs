# 4. Tokens

To define a token , we can run the following:

```
DEFINE TOKEN my_token ON SCOPE account TYPE HS512 VALUE "my_secret_encryption_key";
```

Then we can signup with the following object passed as a parameter which will also generate a token with the following info:

```
{ 
  "iss": "Auth0", 
  "account": "account:ajd82kvn48vl2m3", 
  "exp": 1516239022, 
  "NS": "my_ns", 
  "DB": "my_db", 
  "SC": "account", 
  "TK": "my_token", 
  "ID": "user:10fnvk20r8vn20eiv" 
}
```

Then you can use the token or the auth variable in permissions clauses:

```sql
DEFINE FIELD account ON TABLE note
  PERMISSIONS
    FOR create, update, select, delete
    -- Where the account field of the JWT (which is a record id) matches the account field of the document
      WHERE account = $token.account 
      -- The account field of the logged-in user (taken from the ID field on the JWT) matches the account field of the document
      OR account = $auth.account 
```

The use of scopes is flexible. You could have a 'permissions' object on each user account which specifies what a user could do, and then you could check that on each of the permissions clauses, or you could segregate different user types (admins / users) into separate scopes.
