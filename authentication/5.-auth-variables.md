# 5. Auth Variables

In SurrealDB, there are built-in variables that can be used:

* `$auth` taken from the `ID` field in the JWT (is the record id of the logged in user). Therefore `$auth.name.first` would be the user's name.
* `$scope` is the name of the scope (account or contact or something)
* `$token` is the JWT claims (an object)

Then you can use the $token or the $auth variable in permissions clauses:

```sql
DEFINE FIELD account ON TABLE note
  PERMISSIONS
    FOR create, update, select, delete
    -- Where the account field of the JWT (which is a record id) matches the account field of the document
      WHERE account = $token.account 
      -- The account field of the logged-in user (taken from the ID field on the JWT) matches the account field of the document
      OR account = $auth.account 
```

The use of scopes is flexible. You could have a 'permissions' object on each user account which specifies what a user could do, and then you could check that on each of the permissions clauses, or you could segregate different user types (admins / users) into separate scopes.
