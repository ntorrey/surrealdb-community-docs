# 6. Table Permissions

You could set up a table's permissions like this:

<pre class="language-sql"><code class="lang-sql">DEFINE TABLE contact SCHEMAFULL 
<strong>	PERMISSIONS 
</strong>		FOR select 
			WHERE ($scope = "account" AND account = $account AND (SELECT * FROM $auth.access WHERE account = $account AND (admin = true OR permissions.crm ∋ "s") LIMIT 1)) 
			OR ($scope = "contact" AND id = $auth.id) 
			OR ($scope = "contact" AND distinct(applications.*.campaign.*.connections.*.contact) ∋ $auth.id) 
			OR ($scope = "contact" AND distinct(connections.*.campaign.*.connections.*.contact) ∋ $auth.id) 
		FOR create 
			WHERE ($scope = "account" AND account = $account AND (SELECT * FROM $auth.access WHERE account = $account AND (admin = true OR permissions.crm ∋ "c") LIMIT 1)) 
		FOR update 
			WHERE ($scope = "account" AND account = $account AND (SELECT * FROM $auth.access WHERE account = $account AND (admin = true OR permissions.crm ∋ "u") LIMIT 1)) 
			OR ($scope = "contact" AND id = $auth.id) 
			OR ($scope = "contact" AND distinct(applications.*.campaign.*.connections.*.contact) ∋ $auth.id) 
		FOR delete 
			WHERE ($scope = "account" AND account = $account AND (SELECT * FROM $auth.access WHERE account = $account AND (admin = true OR permissions.crm ∋ "d") LIMIT 1))</code></pre>

(∋ means "Contains". You can also write it as CONTAINS)
